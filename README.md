# HPB Node Operators Code of Conduct

## Welcoming Environment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, 
High Performance Blockchain Node operators pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by High Performance Blockchain Node operators include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Participating in the purchase of votes through non-official backchannels

## Responsibilities

High Performance Blockchain Node operators are responsible for ensuring clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to use their voice against any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community as a High Performance Blockchain Node.
Examples of representing while being identifiable as a High Performance Blockchain Node could be
in an email, posting on Telegram or WeChat, posting on social media, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at hpb@hpb.io. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
